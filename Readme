#Realms: A thing that I wrote.

Realms is my super simple first attempt at writing a JavaScript library.

I wanted to do some work with the canvas, and found that there was a lot of talk
about boilerplate and having to write your own state handling.  Of course there
are several swell looking libraries out there, but I didn't write them!
